# Meme Generator for BBD
A meme generator created for the BBD Build Challenge 2021 and for my module in my final year of university. 

# Questions:

## What niche community/societal problem does this cross-platform application solve?
This meme generator was created to help people who casually enjoy memes to get more involved.  It has different meme templates to choose from with the ability to insert whatever text the user wishers either on the top, bottom, or both of the meme picture. You can easily create a custom meme with the ability to either use your devices camera and take a picture in real time or choose a photo from your gallery to use instead. These features make it easier for users to be more involved with the community whilst creating content that has a sense of uniqueness to them. 

## What distinct screens are used?
Firstly, we have the first screen the user encounters. This is the screen with the meme templates and buttons. Pressing on the ‘Take photo with camera’ button will open a screen using the camera on your device to take a picture. Pressing the ‘Choose photo from gallery’ will open a screen with the users’ gallery so that they may choose a custom photo from their device’s storage. These buttons will ask for permission to access these components of your device. The user can either accept or decline. The ‘Share meme’ button will open a screen to allow the user to share their creation on a different platform.

## Is there integration of platform capabilities?
This app utilises the camera and storage of the user’s device. When taking a picture, the app will ask for permission to use the device’s camera and will use whatever picture the user captures as the meme template. When selecting a picture from the device’s gallery, the app will request permission to access the device’s storage to select an image to be used as the meme template.
